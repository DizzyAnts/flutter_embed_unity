* **Breaking change:** due to a change in namespace, you MUST upgrade the `SendToFlutter.cs` script in your Unity project to use the new version from [the v0.0.2-beta release assets flutter_embed_unity_2022_3.unitypackage](https://github.com/learntoflutter/flutter_embed_unity/releases). Alternatively you can review [the source for SendToFlutter.cs](https://github.com/learntoflutter/flutter_embed_unity/blob/main/example_unity_2022_3_project/Assets/FlutterEmbed/SendToFlutter/SendToFlutter.cs) and make the change to the `AndroidJavaClass` package namespace manually.
